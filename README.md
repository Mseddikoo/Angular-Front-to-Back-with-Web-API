"# Angular-Front-to-Back-with-Web-API" 
"Angular is great for building front-end client-side applications to interact with the user. But most fully featured Web applications also need back-end services to handle data management, user authentication, and other processing. This course focuses on the touch points between an Angular front-end client application and a back-end service built with ASP.NET Web API."
